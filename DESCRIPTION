Package: formr
Title: formr survey framework
Description: The formr R package provides a few convenience functions
    that may be useful to the users of formr (formr.org), an online
    survey framework which heavily relies on R via openCPU.
    Some of the functions are for conveniently generating individual
    feedback graphics, some are just shorthands to make certain common
    operations in formr more palatable to R novices.
